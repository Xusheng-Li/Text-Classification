# Text-Classification
Implement Chinese news text classification based on the Naive Bayes algorithm. Complete preprocessing (word segmentation, stop word removal, punctuation cleaning), feature extraction (vocabulary construction, feature vector generation), model training and evaluation on 56,821 Chinese news abstract data samples. Introduce Laplace smoothing to solve the zero-probability problem, and finally achieve multi-category (10 categories including culture/entertainment/sports) classification prediction for news texts, outputting classification accuracy and detailed evaluation reports.
